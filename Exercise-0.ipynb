    "In this exercise we will do some simple programming tasks with neural networks with the aim to a) introduce you to the programming tools and libraries we'll be using and b) teach you some neural networks fundamentals and test your understanding of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will use a collection of perceptrons (i.e. a single-layer neural network) to classify the digits shown on a seven-segment display.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will implement the perceptrons using numpy and set the weights of those perceptrons by hand (without any actual machine learning) to classify the digits. This task will hopefully teach you the inner workings of individual artificial neurons as well as how changing weights and biases can make a network of neurons learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second we will implement the same single-layer neural network in PyTorch and try to use machine learning to learn the correct weights. This task will hopefully teach you how to do basic network training in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will move away from the seven-segment display and try to train a larger artificial neural network (ANN) to tackle the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. This task will hopefully prepare you to take on larger machine learning tasks with Pytorch as well as give you some insight into how machine learning can be used to solve problems that are diffcult (if not impossible) to program exactly right.\n",

    "A seven-segment display [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display] can be used to display the different digits by turning the different segments (A,B,C,D,E,F) on or off. Your task is to design ten different perceptrons (which together make a single-layer neural network) that recognizes the ten different digits (0,1,2,3, ... ,9) represented by a seven-segment display. The input to each perceptron will be a vector {A,B,C,D,E,F} where A is 1 if segment A is turned on and 0 otherwise (and the same for all the other segments).\n",

    "\n",
    "This means that for each digit you should create a perceptron and to check which digit the network thinks is displayed we input the vector {A,B,C,D,E,F} to each perceptron and then we check which perceptron gives the greatest output value. For each digit (0 to 9) the corresponding perceptron shoud have the greatest output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example we want to input 2 into the network. The digit two corresponds to the vector {1,1,0,1,1,0,1} so we input that into each perceptron. Then we check the output value of each perceptron and see which one is greatest. If the perceptron at index 2 (the third pereptron since we have a perceptron for 0 as well) gives the greatest output then our networks is working for the input 2. Now we finally need to check the other digits as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this task we use numpy rather than PyTorch.\n",
